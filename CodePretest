edges <- read.csv("Edgelist1.1 - Tabellenblatt1.csv", header=T, as.is=T, sep=",")
edges
head(edges)

nodes <- read.csv("Nodelist1.0 - Tabellenblatt1.csv", header=T, as.is=T, sep=",")
ties <- as.matrix(edges)



PreTest1 <- graph_from_data_frame(d=edges, vertices=nodes, directed=TRUE)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
